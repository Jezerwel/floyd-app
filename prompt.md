Explore the entire code repository thoroughly. Analyze and understand the codebase from three key perspectives:

- Software Architect – Focus on system design, architecture patterns, and scalability.

- Software Developer – Examine code structure, implementation details, and maintainability.

- Product Manager – Evaluate features, usability, user flows, and alignment with business goals.

After your analysis, compile all findings into a comprehensive codebase.md file. This document must:

- Be written in Markdown.
- Include Mermaid diagrams to explain system architecture, workflows, or processes.
- Be clearly structured and easy to navigate.
- Provide actionable insights or questions that could guide further development or refinement.
